#  Project Title: Codecharge Automation Framework

## Overview

This repository hosts a robust **Automation Testing Framework** developed for the http://examples.codecharge.com/Portal/Default.php. The framework utilizes a powerful combination of industry-standard tools to implement a **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** approach, ensuring highly readable, maintainable, and scalable test automation.

## Framework Features

* **BDD Compliance:** Features and scenarios are written in Gherkin, promoting collaboration between technical and business teams.
* **Page Object Model (POM):** Designed for code reusability and maintainability by separating test logic from page locators.


## 📈 Reporting

Test execution reports are automatically generated upon completion.
